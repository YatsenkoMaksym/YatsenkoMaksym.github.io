# Portfolio website :&rpar;
I wanted to create a minimalistic Portfolio website for myself.
With no expirience in comercial web development and design, I did my best with coming up with everything by myself.

## Technologies that I've used
* The core of this webside - next.js with TS. It's robust and scalable (idk why I need ts for such a small project. A habit ig).
* Styling and some of the animations - tailwindcss. It's easy to understand, and with tailwind-merges' cn function, you can even make it easy-to-read (didn't use this trick that often).
* Won't hide it, I've used "Infinite Moving Cards" from Aceternity UI.
* Animations - motion (framer-motion). I'd love to work more with it, it's like a swiss knife for animations.

## Why hire me ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

1. I will do my best to exceed your expectations

3. I am motivated to get a job and keep it for as long as I can.
